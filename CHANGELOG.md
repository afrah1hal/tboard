## board v.0.5.1

* BUGFIX: the web page was mistakenly opening connections to `localhost`. Replaced it with a protocol-relative URL.

## board v.0.5.0

* Moved the CSS to the main project; not it's easier for everyone to style the proeject.

## board v.0.4.0

* Added sample boards and jobs.
* Code cleaned up.
* The app needs styling updates, and also a proper README needs to be written.

## board v.0.3.0

* Initially working version. 
* All internal modules are moved to `board.*` npm dependencies; the project's
 structure is "much" cleaner right now.
